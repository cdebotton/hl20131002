						<h3>Japanese Food</h3>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>There's a lot of variety</h2>
					<p>When most people think of Japanese food, they think of food that centers largely around fish.</p>
					<p>There's a lot more to it than that, today I'm going to talk about a few different things.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<ol>
						<li>Sushi</li>
						<li class="fragment">Kaiseiki</li>
						<li class="fragment">Izakaya &amp; Street Food</li>

						<h1>寿司</h1>
						<iframe width="840" height="473" data-autoplay src="//www.youtube.com/embed/Lty7RAHKT9E" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
						<h2>Sushi</h2>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Origin</h2>
						<p>Sushi, though originally believed to develop in Southeast Asia along the Mekong River, originated from the Edo region during the Edo period (江戸時代) in Japan &mdash; 1603-1868.</p>
						<img src="/img/edo.jpg" style="height: 500px; width: auto;" />
						<p>Tokyo is modern day Edo, the name was changed when Tokyo became the nation's capital.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<img src="/img/panel-2.jpg">
						<p>Sushi, in its simplest form, is vinegared rice and raw fish.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Oh shit, there's more</h2>

						<h1>Kaiseki</h1>
						<img src="/img/kaiseiki2.jpg">
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>What the hell is it?</h2>
						<p>Kaiseiki is more or less the Japanese equivalent of French Haute cuisine. What's Haute cuisine? Really expensive, really upscale, really pretty food.</p>
						<img src="/img/nomoney.jpg" style="height: 300px; width: auto;">
						<p>Kaiseki can be thought of as banquet food. It typically is served in anywhere between three and twelve courses (or more). It typically begins with miso soup, has vegetable, fish, and red meat courses, and ends with a dessert.</p>
					</section>
					<section>

						<h1>Izakaya &amp; Street Food</h1>
						<img src="/img/getweird.gif">
						<p class="fragment">When you prefer your meal with a side of shame and regret.</p>
						<p class="fragment"><small>And who doesn't? Amiright?</small></p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Let's start with Izakaya</h2>
						<p>Izakaya is a Japanese drinking establishment that also serves food.</p>
						<img src="/img/yakitori.jpg" style="height: 400px; width: auto;">
						<p>The food served at Izakaya is pretty standard. Grilled meat (or vegetables) on a stick. Everyone's into that, right? No? You should feel ashamed.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>That doesn't sound weird?</h2>
						<h4>Calm the hell down, I'm not done.</h4>
						<p>Izakaya is also where you'll find unusual dishes like chicken hearts on a skewer (which are delicious), as well as calf liver sashimi. That one's not so nice.</p>
						<img src="/img/chickenhearts.jpg" style="height: 400px; width: auto;">
						<p> Also, bull penis. I decided to leave the picture of this one out. But you can get it at Kenka.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h1>Where can I get that awesome grilled bullshit on a skewer?</h1>

						<h2>St. Marks is your friend.</h2>

						<h4>... Just watch out for the gutter punks. They're probably not your friends.</h4>

						<h2>Yakitori Taisho</h2>
						<p>Huge menu, lots of cheap alcohol, relatively clean.</p>
						<img src="/img/taisho.jpg" style="float: left; width: 48%; height: auto; position: relative;"><img src="/img/taisho2.jpg" style="float: left; width: 48%; height: auto; position: relative; margin-left: 2%;">
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Kenka</h2>
						<p>Huge-er menu, cheaper alcohol, not as clean, but hey, smoking area!</p>
						<p style="display: block; clear: left; position: relative;"><small>On second thought, everything is somewhat questionably cheap. Also the wait on this one is usually longer than Taisho.</small></p>
						<p><small><em>Fantastic if you want to make a few mistakes!</em></small></p>
						<img src="/img/kenka.jpg" style="float: left; width: 45%; height: auto; position: relative;"><img src="/img/kenka2.jpg" style="float: left; width: 45%; height: auto; position: relative; margin-left: 2%; clear: right;">

					<section>
						<h2>Oh yeah, and street food</h2>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Okonomiyaki</h2>
						<img src="/img/okonomiyaki.jpg">
						<p>お好み焼き literally transaltes to "What you love, grilled."</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>What is it?</h2>
						<p>Okonomiyaki is a savory pancake typically comprised of cabbage, flour, yam, onions, and various proteins such as pork belly, bacon, squid, shrimp, octopus... It's pretty much whatever the hell you want in it (or whatever the person that's making it wants).</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Major Variations</h2>
						<p><strong>Osaka style</strong> is thicker style pancake typically topped with mayo and okonomiyaki sauce. This is predominantly what you'll find in the United States.</p>
						<p style="margin-top: 100px;"><strong>Okinawa style</strong> is thinner than the Osaka variant, and is typically more of a home cooked item as opposed to something you'd find on the street (at night, probably a little buzzed).</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h1>Other cool things! Yeah!</h1>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Takoyaki</h2>
						<img src="/img/takoyaki.jpg" style="width: auto; height: 400px;">
						<p>A ball shaped item cooked in a special grill that is made of flour and pieces of octopus tentacle.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>The Yakisoba is a lie</h2>
						<img src="/img/yakisoba.jpg" style="width: auto; height: 400px;">
						<p>Pan fried noodles. Typically served with shredded cabbage, pickled daikon, and any sort of protein. Although the name suggests that buckwheat noodles are used, that's just a flat out lie, and you'll usually find something similar to a ramen noodle in Yakisoba.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Otafuku</h2>
						<h4>East Village (9th st)</h4>
						<img src="/img/otafuku.jpg" style="height: 400px; width: auto;">
						<p>There's only one good place in New York City to get these three dishes. Taisho and Kenka serve them, but don't be an idiot, just get this shit at Otafuku</p>
						<p>You can get a large portion of each item individually or in combos of two.</p>

						<h2>Ramen &amp; Soba</h2>
						<iframe width="840" height="473" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/W_KctoG0bAE" frameborder="0" data-autoplay allowfullscreen></iframe>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Let's start with Ramen</h2>
						<img src="/img/ramen.jpg" style="height: 500px; width: auto;">
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Although ramen (ラーメン) is often recognized as a Japanese dish, it's actually made with a Chinese style noodle. It is served in a broth of either fish, pork, or chicken stock, and can have any sort of toppings on it. Typically, you will find a sheet of nori, pork belly, a soy-soaked egg, ginger, green onions, enoki mushrooms, and menma (fermented bamboo shoots).</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<img src="/img/momofuku.jpg" style="height: 400px; width: auto;">
						<p>After World War 2, cheap instant noodles were introduced to Japan by Momofuku Ando. By the 1980s, ramen was extremely popular in Japanese culture.</p>

						<h1>Oh yeah, Soba</h1>
						<img src="/img/soba.jpg">
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Soba is a buckwheat noodle, and is served either chilled or in a hot broth in Japanese cuisine. When served hot, it is often presented in a bowl of a soy based broth with various vegetable and meat toppings. Soba is great if you want noodles but want something healthy, as a typical serving (100g) has about 344 calories.</p>
						<p>Cold soba is served with a cold dipping sauce and the toppings are served on the side to mix in with your dipping broth. Often, the hot water that was used to cook the soba is brought out toward the end of the meal to drink.</p>
